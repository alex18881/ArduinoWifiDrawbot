#Info
Here is located some additional and usefull info: Schemes, AT commands, PCB etc.

##Wiring scheme
The wiring scheme contains a voltage regulator. Be carefull the one is used in this scheme is just ASM1117 3.3 with no letters at the end, but there's also ASM1117-REF which requires an ajustable resistor between its ground connector and the ground itself.

The scheme is took from [here](http://arduino.ru/forum/apparatnye-voprosy/podklyuchenie-regulyatora-napryazheniya-ams1117-33v). There's also a separate PCB for it in the same post on that page.
